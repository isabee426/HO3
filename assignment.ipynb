    "# Part XC: Extra Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you have used a synthetic dataset that was created just for you.\n",
    "But, data science is always more interesting when you are dealing with actual data from the real world.\n",
    "Therefore, you will have an opportunity for extra credit on this assignment using real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For extra credit, repeat the **written tasks** of Parts 0 through 4 with an additional dataset that you find yourself.\n",
    "For the written portion of the extra credit for Part 0, include information about where you got the data and what the data represents.\n",
    "You may choose any dataset that represents real data (i.e., is **not** synthetic or generated)\n",
    "and is **not** [pre-packaged in scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some of the many places you can start looking for datasets:\n",
    " - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) -- Kaggle is a website focused around machine learning competitions,\n",
    "       where people compete to see who can get the best results on a dataset.\n",
    "       It is very popular in the machine learning community and has thousands of datasets with descriptions.\n",
    "       Make sure to read the dataset's description, as Kaggle also has synthetic datasets.\n",
    " - [data.gov](https://data.gov/) -- A portal for data from the US government.\n",
    "        The US government has a lot of data, and much of it has to be available to the public by law.\n",
    "        This portal contains some of the more organized data from several different government agencies.\n",
    "        In general, the government has A LOT of interesting data.\n",
    "        It may not always be clean (remember the CIA factbook), but it is interesting and available.\n",
    "        All data here should be real-world, but make sure to read the description to verify.\n",
    " - [UCI's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) -- UC Irvine has their own data repository with a few hundred datasets on many different topics.\n",
    "        Make sure to read the dataset's description, as UCI also has synthetic datasets.\n",
    " - [WHO's Global Health Observatory](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home) -- The World Health Organization keeps track of many different health-related statistics for most of the countries in the world.\n",
    "        All data here should be real-world, but make sure to read the description to verify.\n",
    " - [Google's Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) -- Google indexes many datasets that can be searched here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even create a dataset from scratch if you find some data you like that is not already organized into a specific dataset.\n",
    "The only real distinction between \"data\" and a \"dataset\" is that a dataset is organized and finite (has a fixed size).\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new section in your written report for this extra credit and include all the written tasks for the extra credit there.\n",
    "Each written task/section that you complete for your new dataset is eligible for extra credit (so you can still receive some extra credit even if you do not complete all parts).\n",
    "There is no need to submit any code for the extra credit.\n",
    "If you created a new dataset, include the dataset or links to it with your submission."
